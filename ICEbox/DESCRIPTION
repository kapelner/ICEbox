Description: This package implements Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. ICE plots refine Friedman's partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and a covariate of interest for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate of interest, suggesting where and to what extent they may exist.
